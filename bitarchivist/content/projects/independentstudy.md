# Access to Born-Digital Architectural Records

Paper available in its entirety [here](/docs/walsh_CADArchiving2015_final.pdf).

This independent study supplemented other coursework taken in the MS in Library and Information Science program at Simmons College, including Digital Stewardship, Metadata, Database Management, Appraisal of Archives and Manuscripts, and Archival Access and Use. As such, this reading list assumes some prior knowledge in archival theory and practice, general computing, and issues and challenges related to digital preservation.
