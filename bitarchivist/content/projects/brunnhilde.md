# Brunnhilde

Brunnhilde is a Python-based command-line and GUI tool for characterization of directories and disk images that builds on Richard Lehane's [Siegfried](http://itforarchivist.com/siegfried).

Brunnhilde was written to supplement existing file format identification and characterization tools, with a focus on producing human-readable high-level reports for digital archives and digital preservation practiioners.

Originally developed as a proof of concept tool, Brunnhilde is installed as a standard utility in [BitCurator](https://wiki.bitcurator.net/index.php?title=Main_Page) v1.8.0+ and is in use at a number of archives, libraries, and other collecting institutions.

See more information (including installation and detailed usage instructions) on [Github](https://github.com/timothyryanwalsh/brunnhilde).
